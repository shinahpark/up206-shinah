## Week1 reading assignment
Prompt: This week's reading assignment is for you to find an article, blog, journal, chapter, or book that talks about data/information/knowledge/coding that includes some spatial component. Make sure it is something that you would like to share with the class. Then, write a paragraph (yes, a paragraph, not two) that summarizes the article. Write a second paragraph where you reflect critically and creatively about the material in your own words. Why did this article speak to you in regards to your approach to data and research? How does it inform you own data science goals?


## A roundtable discussion: Defining urban data science (2019)
#### Organizer: Wei Kang, Taylor Oshan, Levi Wolf | Discussants: Geoff Boeing, Vanessa Frias-Martinez, Song Gao, Ate Poorthuis, Wenfei Xu

This article is a report written after a roundtable discussion done by scholars addressing data science in relation to urban studies. The main issue of the discussion is how to define urban data science. The discussion is processed by one organizer showing an agenda and panels tell their thought about each topic. Organizers aimed to make panels define urban data science (UDS) and identify core research questions or research practices for the field. One of the questions is ‘How do we know it is urban data science when we see it? What makes UDS distinct from spatial statistics, geocomputation, or urban studies?’. Wenfei answered that it is just a matter of labeling which depends on the audience. Ate answered that UDS should be defined by foundational research questions as a starting point, not a data. Another interesting question was ‘What are the goals for UDS?’. The panels answered that we should think why we use UDS first to answer the question. Geoff said that UDS has limitations that sometimes it focuses excessively on technical methodology rather than admitting that there can be other qualitative methods to interpret a question. Geoff also stated that analyzing data is not only data science but the parts of it includes other skills that needs theories, meaning there is more than just data science. There were other interesting arguments about the necessity in community involvement in data collecting and companies’ duty of share good quality of big data for researchers.   

For the question about how to distinct UDS from other similar disciplines, I agreed with Wenfei that it is the research question that determines the real meaning of the analysis result. In addition, I thought Geoff’s opinion that ‘data science must be embedded in a discipline, so UDS must be embedded within the broader conversations in urban studies’ is an integral part we should think when process data. Looking at these points, I concluded that the importance of defining a good research question is emerging. The results of analysis remain meaningless unless the purpose is not determined properly. Also, the need for interpreting technical methodologies within urban studies is necessary because the data analysis skills itself is just data science, rather than urban data science. This reading made me to think the essence of urban data science and gave me an opportunity to think about how the direction should set when applying data science in urban planning.
