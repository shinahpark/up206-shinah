## Week3 Reading Assignment   

This is a response written after watching Geoff Boeing’s presentation to urban planners. You can watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjp4mxvpoBo&feature=youtu.be)

In this video, I was able to see Geoff’s introduction of his motive of studying urban data science and connecting it to urban theories. Hearing the introduction of the research during his Ph.D, I could understand why he developed OSMnx. He told the students that there were barriers he noticed that made him difficult to fully leverage useful data in studying urban planning. Therefore, with his background in computer science, he developed the tool himself and provided opportunity for everyone to see further than they did. Actually, I am one of the users of OSMnx. I used the toolkit when I was conducting undergraduate capstone research which aimed to find the relationship between commercial land use and street network pattern. The library was useful to bring the OpenStreetMap and change the streets into networks with node and links. I was also able to calculate the centrality indices. As someone asked in the video to Geoff, I also was wondering how this tool could enhance the policies and planning practices in real world. Geoff answered that more institutions and consulting companies are using it so he hoping to see more practical advances. Once again learned the importance of data analysis that helps planners to make compelling decisions based on urban data. The world is changing so fast so knowing how to manage data is a strength in exploring urban studies.
