## Introduction of this space

Welcome to the world of **Spatial Data Analysis**. :grinning:   
This is a space created for Shinah Park who is currently a master's student in urban planning at UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs.
I will stack resources and assignments that are provided througout the course **UP206A : Introduction to Geographic Information Systems and Spatial Data Analysis**. Through this course, I aim to understand the role and objectives of various types of data that can be acquired from various institutions. Moreover, I hope to get used to the concept of spatial data analysis as well as the technical skills that are widely used when conducting spatial analysis. The importance of collecting and using data to interpret the society we live is going higher, so I hope to learn a lot from the course and manage this space after the end of the course.

## Final Project Interests

Since I am interested in transportation policy and planning, I would like to conduct a final project in relation to transportation. I am opened to any general topics that are related with interpreting current conditions in terms of access to opportunities. Particularly, I am interested in conducting analysis of street or public transportation network. People's travel behavior is also one of my interest but I am not sure if I can combine network analysis and travel behavior into a project in a short time.
